[ Bi(111) monolayer ]
This folder contains steps to obtain Hamiltonian under wannier representation for later Z2 calculations.

------------------------------------------------

[all VASP calculation were performed using recommanded LDA pseudopotentials]
* -> command to issue
~ -> analysis
- -> detail

1. Structural relaxation
  * run VASP

2. SCF calculation to obtain wavefunction 'WAVECAR' and charge density 'CHGCAR'.
  * copy 'CONTCAR' from step 1 to this directory as 'POSCAR'.
  * run VASP

3. non-selfconsistent calculation to get bandstructure.
  * copy 'CHGCAR' and 'POSCAR' from step 2 to this directory.
  ~ analysis band composition for later wannier projection:
   * using p4vasp's “fat band analysis” (sometimes called “projected band”) function to analysis orbital contribution to the band structure.
   - the total number of bloch bands is 48 (grep NBANDS OUTCAR in step 2), low-lying s-orbital dominated 4 bloch bands could be excluded in the wannierisation.
    (?) I made a mistake here. in the wannier90.win file, I only excluded 2 low lying s-orbitals in the projection step. However, because the other 2 bands lies in different
        energy window than desired p-orbtial band, they will not affect the final result. That means they are useless bloch band just like high energy empty bands.
   - we only want to consider p-orbitals for initial projection.
   - fat band analysis shows p-orbital contribution in conduction band is entangled with other empty bands, thus, disentangle procedure is needed here.
   - the disentanglement window could be easily calculated:
	dis_win_min  = -7.2   # the minimal energy for disentangle window, I set this below lowest occupied p-orbital band energy, above s-orbital band.
	dis_win_max  =  3.5   # the maximal energy for disentangle window, setting this higher than highest band energy is usually harmless.
	dis_froz_min = -7.2   # because no entangled band is included in the lower part of disentanglement windows, this equals to dis_win_min.
	dis_froz_max =  1.45  # usually, this is set to lowest non-considered (here, non-p-orbital in fat band anslysis) band energy.


4. Generate initial projection for wannier90 input using VASP.
  ~ please check wannier90.win file, make sure you understand everything. If not, please check wannier90's manual.
  ~ LWANNIER90 = .TRUE. is added to the INCAR, and I commented out ISTART tag so VASP will automatically reads WAVECAR
  ~ note that I did not write atomic position and cell vector here. These part will be automatically filled by VASP2wannier90 interface.
  * once 'wannier90.win' file is written, copy 'WAVECAR' from step 2 to this folder and run VASP.
  * VASP will generate 'wannier90.mmn' 'wannier90.eig' 'wannier90.amn' and make up whats missing in the 'wannier90.win' file.

5. Wannier90 calculation, see REAEME file in the '5-wannier_cal' folder.

6. Wannier_tools calculation to calculate wilson loop to get Z2, read README in '6-WT' folder.

[ In2Se3 monolayer ]
This folder contains steps to obtain Hamiltonian under wannier representation and calculate its spintexture.

------------------------------------------------

[all VASP calculation were performed using recommanded LDA pseudopotentials]
* -> command to issue
~ -> analysis
- -> detail

1. Structural relaxation
  * run VASP

2. SCF calculation to obtain wavefunction 'WAVECAR' and charge density 'CHGCAR'.
  * copy 'CONTCAR' from step 1 to scf_PBE directory as 'POSCAR'.
  * run VASP
  * copy 'WAVECAR' from scf_PBE to scf_SOC directory
  * run VASP

3. non-selfconsistent calculation to get bandstructure.
	* copy 'CHGCAR' and 'POSCAR' from scf_PBE to scf_PBE directory.
  * copy 'CHGCAR' and 'POSCAR' from scf_SOC to scf_SOC directory.
  ~ analysis band composition with scf_SOC for later wannier projection:
   * using p4vasp's “fat band analysis” (sometimes called “projected band”) function to analysis orbital contribution to the band structure.
   - the total number of bloch bands is 72 (grep NBANDS OUTCAR in step 2), we can see In atoms' s-orbital and Se atoms' p-orbital clustered around a single band.
   - fat band analysis shows orbital contribution in conduction band does not entangled with other empty bands, thus, no disentangle procedure is needed here.

4. Generate initial projection for wannier90 input using VASP.
  ~ please check wannier90.win file, make sure you understand everything. If not, please check wannier90's manual.
  ~ LWANNIER90 = .TRUE. is added to the INCAR, and I commented out ISTART tag so VASP will automatically reads WAVECAR
  ~ note that I did not write atomic position and cell vector here. These part will be automatically filled by VASP2wannier90 interface.
  * once 'wannier90.win' file is written, copy 'WAVECAR' from step 2 to this folder and run VASP.
  ~ VASP will generate 'wannier90.mmn' 'wannier90.eig' 'wannier90.amn' and make up whats missing in the 'wannier90.win' file.

5. Wannier90 calculation, see REAEME file in the '5-wannier_cal' folder.

6. Wannier_tools calculation to calculate spintexture, read README in '6-WT' folder.
  ~ because wannier_tools only allows spintexture calculation with bulk materials. Here we treats vacuum direction of 2D materials as cut surface to calculate spintexutre.

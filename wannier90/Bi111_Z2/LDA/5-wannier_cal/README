This folder contains steps to calculate wannier90 bandstructure and generate tight-binding Hamiltonian under wanneir90 representation.

------------------------------------------------

1. using wannier90.amm, wannier90.mmn, wannier90.eig and wannier90.win file generated by VASP, generate maximally localised wannier functions.
  * issue "wannier90.x wannier90 & " to run in W90 in the background.

2. using obtained wannier functions to get bulk band structure, compare them with one calculated with DFT.
  * copy 'wannier90.chk' and 'wannier90.eig' from step 1 to this folder, issue "wannier90.x wannier90 & " to run in W90 in the background.
  * issue "gnuplot --presist wannier90_band.gnu" to get bandstructure.

3. using obtained wannier functions to get wannier hamiltonian.
  * copy 'wannier90.chk' and 'wannier90.eig' from step 1 to this folder, issue "wannier90.x wannier90 & " to run in W90 in the background.
  * examine output file 'wannier90_hr.dat'
